While working on a project, I came across the need to know how constraints and indexes are related to each other. Here are a few key things to know.

The COTS app I was upgrading was a patch version upgrade and required a database migration to be perfomed. Given that this was a patch version upgrade, I did not expect any schema changes. When I looked into the fixed
issues they indicated:

> The index can be renamed (usually can happen when backup and restore tools by users that deliberately rename the index)

> When  attempting to delete the original index while doing a migration, it (silently) fails and the constraints still exist in database

> Some migrations then fail because they donâ€™t expect this index to be present

So based on this a few questions come to mind:

### Why does renaming an index not also update the constraints to point to the new index name? 

The reason is that indexes and constraints are separate database objects that are related but independent of each other.

When an index is renamed, the name change only applies to the index itself. Any constraints that reference the original index name are not automatically updated to point to the new name. This is by design, as renaming an index should not cause implicit/silent schema changes to constraints.

Backup tools that rename indexes are likely doing so for identification/labeling purposes during the backup/restore process. But the database itself treats indexes and constraints as separate objects that reference each other by name. So a rename on the index side does not propagate or cascade an update to constraints that reference it.

 This can subsequently cause issues, as was seen in this case, if migrations expect the original index name but get the renamed one instead. The constraints are still pointing to the old name.

### What is the relationship between an Index and Contrainsts?

Before discussing the relationship between indexes and constraints, it's important to understand what each one is:

**Constrainsts** are rules placed on the data to enforce integrity. Constraints are applied at the column or table level and prevent invalid data from being inserted or updated. Common constraints include primary keys, foreign keys, not null, unique, check constraints etc.

An **Index** is defined as a way to quickly locate and access records in a database table. Indexes are data structures that contain keys built from one or more columns in a table, along with pointers to the actual row locations. Indexes are used to speed up queries and sorts on columns they are built for.

Now that there is a foundational understanding of each, here is the relationship between indexes and constraints:

Foreign key and unique constraints often utilize indexes internally to efficiently validate the data. When a foreign key or unique constraint is created, the database will automatically create a matching index if one does not already exist. This index supports the validation performed by the constraint. 

Let's consider a scenario where you have two tables, "Orders" and "Customers." The "Orders" table has a foreign key referencing the "Customers" table to maintain the relationship between orders and their corresponding customers. To optimize lookup operations based on customer IDs, an index is created on the foreign key column in the "Orders" table. 

If the index is renamed, the foreign key constraint in the "Orders" table will still reference the original index name. So if you have a database migration that expects to delete original index and remove references to the index in any constraints, it will fail or produce unexpected results since the constraint is still pointing to the old index name. The constraint and index remain out of sync after the index rename.
