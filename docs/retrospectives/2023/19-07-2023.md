## Retrospective

1. Git committer email mismatch

While trying to push to a development instance of GitLab, I encountered the following error:

```
remote: GitLab: Committer's email 'John.Doe@team.example.com' does not follow the pattern '@test\.team\.example\.com$'
```

I had the correct email configured in my local and global `~/.gitconfig` file with multiple git [profiles](../../insights/2023/17-04-2023/multi-git-profiles.md) to target different environments.

Running `git config user.email` within the repo displayed the correct email as per regex pattern. 

After some head scratching it occured to me that the initial commit was using `John.Doe@team.example.com` (I only setup the git profile for dev after the first commit!).

Had to fix this by running:

```
git -c user.name="John Doe" -c user.email=John.Doe@test.team.example.com commit --amend --reset-author
```

This will amend the last commit, resetting the author email to match the required pattern.
