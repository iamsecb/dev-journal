## Retrospective

### Stick to the plan

I've been trying to develop a programming  design flow that allows me to keep the bigger picture in mind while working on the tasks
at hand. My current flow goes something like this once the requirements are clear:

1. **Create a skeleton of the codebase** to see the end to end flow. This is meant to enable visualising the call flow, dependencies
   etc. Avoid writing any implementation details. Focus on stringing things together to see enough of the program flow, specially
   from a developer experience perspective e.g: How easy is to make an API call? 
2. **Refine the APIs of the codebase** to reflect the expected API calls you intend to make and use.
3. **Rinse and repeat** until you have clear APIs.

#### Where I went wrong

I faltered when I got caught up in wanting to get things to work and delving into the implementation details immediately instead of following the plan. The problem here is once you are focused on just making things work, the code design mindset moves out of your primary focus. Sure,
you can come back and refactor but at times, there is a chain reaction of refactoring that could have been avoided. I'd say more times
than not, this is what has happened to me.

I also made the cardinal sin of not adding git commits because I had gone too far down the rabbit hole trying to make things work and left with a whale of diffs to categorically pick and commit.
