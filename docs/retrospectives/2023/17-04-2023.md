## Retrospective

1. **Git recursive error when setting up `.gitconfig` file `includeIf`**

	Failed to noticed how I was including the same file within the target file created.

2. **Bash error `unexpected EOF while looking for matching "'`**

	I was only looking at the current line instead of the surrounding code I had previously added. 
	Missed closing quote for a variable that previously defined.
